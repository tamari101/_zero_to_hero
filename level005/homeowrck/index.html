<h1> Pieta</h1>
<hr>

<p> Pietà (Italian: [maˈdɔnna della pjeˈta]; "[Our Lady of] Pity"; 1498–1499) is a Carrara marble sculpture of Jesus and
    Mary at Mount Golgotha representing the "Sixth Sorrow" of the Virgin Mary by Michelangelo Buonarroti, in Saint
    Peter's Basilica, Vatican City, for which it was made . It is a key work of Italian Renaissance sculpture and often
    taken as the start of the High Renaissance.
    <br>
    The sculpture captures the moment when Jesus, taken down from the cross, is given to his mother Mary. Mary looks
    younger than Jesus; art historians believe Michelangelo was inspired by a passage in Dante Alighieri's Divine
    Comedy: "O virgin mother, daughter of your Son [...] your merit so ennobled human nature that its divine Creator did
    not hesitate to become its creature" (Paradiso, Canto XXXIII).[1] Michelangelo's aesthetic interpretation of the
    Pietà is unprecedented in Italian sculpture[2] because it balances early forms of naturalism with the Renaissance
    ideals of classical beauty.

    The statue was originally commissioned by a French cardinal, Jean Bilhères de Lagraulas, then French ambassador in
    Rome. The sculpture was made, probably as an altarpiece, for the cardinal's funeral chapel in Old St Peter's. When
    this was demolished it was preserved, and later took its current location, the first chapel on the north side after
    the entrance of the new basilica, in the 18th century.[3] It is the only piece Michelangelo ever signed.

    The statue was restored after the figure of Mary was vandalized on Pentecost Sunday of 1972 by Laszlo Toth; it was
    until recently protected by a bulletproof glass screen.[4]

    Description, theories and interpretations

    The venerated image with its original canonical crown from 14 August 1637 by the Pontifical decree of Pope Urban
    VIII. Photo circa, 24 May 1888.
    The structure is pyramidal, and the vertex coincides with Mary's head. The statue widens progressively down the
    drapery of Mary's dress, to the base, the rock of Golgotha. The figures are quite out of proportion, owing to the
    difficulty of depicting a fully-grown man cradled full-length in a woman's lap. Much of Mary's body is concealed by
    her monumental drapery, and the relationship of the figures appears quite natural. Michelangelo's interpretation of
    the Pietà was far different from those previously created by other artists, as he sculpted a young and beautiful
    Mary rather than a naturally older woman (aged 45+) that should be commensurate with the natural age of her son,
    Jesus (aged 33).[5]

    The marks of the Crucifixion are limited to very small nail marks and an indication of the wound in Jesus' side.
    Accordingly, Christ's face does not reveal signs of the Passion.[6][better source needed] According to another
    interpretation, when Michelangelo set out to create his Pietà, he wanted to create a work he described as "the
    heart's image".[7]

    Two drilled holes are located at the top head of the Virgin Mary, which once supported the bar holding two
    levitating angels, while another hole is located at the tophead of the Christ image.</p>

<h2>After completion</h2>
<hr>
<p>Following completion, the Pietà's first home was the Chapel of Saint Petronilla, a circular Roman mausoleum attached
    to the south transept of Saint Peter's, with several sub-chapels radiating from the central space. The Cardinal
    chose one of these as his funerary chapel. While there is now no certainty, it is estimated that each of these
    niches measured about 4.5 metres wide by 2 metres deep. The chapel was later demolished by Donato Bramante during
    his rebuilding of the basilica.[10]

    According to Giorgio Vasari, shortly after the installation of his Pietà, Michelangelo overheard someone remark (or
    asked visitors about the sculptor) that it was the work of another sculptor, Cristoforo Solari, whereupon
    Michelangelo signed the sculpture.[11] Michelangelo carved the words on the sash running across Mary's chest.

    MICHÆLANGELVS BONAROTVS FLORENTINVS FACIEBAT
    (English: "Michelangelo Buonarroti, the Florentine made this")

    The signature echoes one used by the ancient Greek artists Apelles and Polykleitos. It was the only work he ever
    signed. Vasari also reports the anecdote that Michelangelo later regretted his outburst of pride and swore never to
    sign another work of his hands.[12][13]

    Fifty years later, Vasari declared the following regarding the Pietà:

    "Never think, a rare sculptor or craftsman, to be able to add design or grace, nor with difficulty never being able
    to finesse, cleanliness and to pierce the marble as much with art, as Michelangelo did there, because you can see in
    it all the value and power of art."

    In 1964, the Pietà was lent by the Vatican to the 1964–1965 New York World's Fair to be installed in the Vatican
    pavilion. The former Archbishop of New York, Cardinal Francis Spellman formally requested the statue from Pope John
    XXIII, appointed Edward M. Kinney, Director of Purchasing and Shipping of Catholic Relief Services – USCC, to head
    up the Vatican Transport Teams.[14] The statue was shipped in a wooden crate 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) thick with an
    8-inch (20 cm) base, secured to the deck of the liner Cristoforo Colombo; in case of an accident, the crate
    contained cushioning so thick that it would float in water, and had an emergency locator beacon as well as a marker
    buoy attached.[15]

    At the fair, people stood in line for hours to catch a glimpse from a conveyor belt moving past the sculpture. It
    was returned to the Vatican afterwards.[16]

    Other Michelangelo Pietàs
    Several decades later, Michelangelo returned twice to the subject of the Pietà, but neither work was completed. The
    Florentine Pietà of c. 1547 – 1553 was apparently intended for his own tomb, but abandoned after several years work.
    It is often called a Deposition, representing a moment slightly earlier in the story. The Rondanini Pietà was begun
    in 1552, and still very unfinished at his death in 1564; he had been working on it six days before.</p>

<h3>Context and development</h3>
<hr>
<p>The Pietà is one of the three common artistic representations of a sorrowful Virgin Mary, the other two being the
    Mater Dolorosa ("dolorous mother") and the Stabat Mater ("standing mother").[3][4] The other two representations are
    most commonly found in paintings, rather than sculpture, although combined forms exist.[5]

    The Pietà developed in Germany (where it is called Vesperbild) about 1300, reached Italy about 1400, and was
    especially popular in Central European Andachtsbilder.[6] Many German and Polish 15th-century examples in wood
    greatly emphasise Christ's wounds. Although the subject was known in Italy, the name may have been slower to be
    adopted, and the Florentine diarist Luca Landucci, after describing a painting in an entry for June 1482, added
    "which is called by some a Pietà".[7]

    The Deposition of Christ and the Lamentation or Pietà form the 13th of the Stations of the Cross, as well as one of
    the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin.

    Although the Pietà most often shows the Virgin Mary holding Jesus, there are other compositions, including those
    where God the Father participates in holding Jesus Christ. In Spain the Virgin often holds up one or both hands,
    sometimes with Christ's body slumped to the floor.</p>
