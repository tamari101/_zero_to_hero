    <h1>fall of constantinopol</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The fall of Constantinople, also known as the conquest of Constantinople, was the capture of the capital of the
        Byzantine Empire by the Ottoman Empire. The city was captured on 29 May 1453 as part of the culmination of a
        55-day siege which had begun on 6 April.

        The attacking Ottoman Army, which significantly outnumbered Constantinople's defenders, was commanded by the
        21-year-old Sultan Mehmed II (later nicknamed "the Conqueror"), while the Byzantine army was led by Emperor
        Constantine XI Palaiologos. After conquering the city, Mehmed II made Constantinople the new Ottoman capital,
        replacing Adrianople.

        The fall of Constantinople and of the Byzantine Empire was a watershed of the Late Middle Ages, marking the
        effective end of the Roman Empire, a state which began in roughly 27 BC and had lasted nearly 1500 years. For
        many modern historians, the fall of Constantinople marks the end of the medieval period and the beginning of the
        early modern period.[20][21] The city's fall also stood as a turning point in military history. Since ancient
        times, cities and castles had depended upon ramparts and walls to repel invaders. The Walls of Constantinople,
        especially the Theodosian Walls, protected Constantinople from attack for 800 years and were noted as some of
        the most advanced defensive systems in the world at the time.[22] However, these fortifications were overcome
        with the use of gunpowder, specifically from Ottoman cannons and bombards, heralding a change in siege
        warfare.[23] The Ottoman cannons repeatedly fired massive cannonballs weighing 500 kilograms (1,100 lb) over 1.5
        kilometres (0.93 mi) which created gaps in the Theodosian Walls for the Ottoman siege.[24][25]</p>

    <h2>The Byzantine Empire</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>In the following eleven centuries, the city had been besieged many times but was captured only once before: the
        Sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204.[26] The crusaders established an unstable Latin state
        in and around Constantinople while the remainder of the Byzantine Empire splintered into a number of successor
        states, notably Nicaea, Epirus and Trebizond. They fought as allies against the Latin establishments, but also
        fought among themselves for the Byzantine throne.

        The Nicaeans eventually reconquered Constantinople from the Latins in 1261, reestablishing the Byzantine Empire
        under the Palaiologos dynasty. Thereafter, there was little peace for the much-weakened empire as it fended off
        successive attacks by the Latins, Serbs, Bulgarians and Ottoman Turks.[27][page needed][28][29][30][page needed]

        Between 1346 and 1349, the Black Death killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople.[31] The city was
        further depopulated by the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453, it consisted of
        a series of walled villages separated by vast fields encircled by the fifth-century Theodosian Walls.

        By 1450, the empire was exhausted and had shrunk to a few square kilometers outside the city of Constantinople
        itself, the Princes' Islands in the Sea of Marmara and the Peloponnese with its cultural center at Mystras. The
        Empire of Trebizond, an independent successor state that formed in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, was also
        present at the time on the coast of the Black Sea.</p>
