    <h1>Alexander the Great</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Alexander III of Macedon (Ancient Greek: Ἀλέξανδρος, romanized: Alexandros; 20/21 July 356 BC – 10/11 June 323
        BC), most commonly known as Alexander the Great,[c] was a king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon.[d] He
        succeeded his father Philip II to the throne in 336 BC at the age of 20 and spent most of his ruling years
        conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout Western Asia, Central Asia, parts of South Asia, and Egypt. By
        the age of 30, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to northwestern
        India.[1] He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered to be one of history's greatest and most
        successful military commanders.[2][3][4]

        Until the age of 16, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle. In 335 BC, shortly after his assumption of kingship
        over Macedon, he campaigned in the Balkans and reasserted control over Thrace and parts of Illyria before
        marching on the city of Thebes, which was subsequently destroyed in battle. Alexander then led the League of
        Corinth, and used his authority to launch the pan-Hellenic project envisaged by his father, assuming leadership
        over all Greeks in their conquest of Persia.[5][6]

        In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid Persian Empire and began a series of campaigns that lasted for 10 years.
        Following his conquest of Asia Minor, Alexander broke the power of Achaemenid Persia in a series of decisive
        battles, including those at Issus and Gaugamela; he subsequently overthrew Darius III and conquered the
        Achaemenid Empire in its entirety.[e] <br> After the fall of Persia, the Macedonian Empire held a vast swath of
        territory between the Adriatic Sea and the Indus River. Alexander endeavored to reach the "ends of the world and
        the Great Outer Sea" and invaded India in 326 BC, achieving an important victory over Porus, an ancient Indian
        king of present-day Punjab, at the Battle of the Hydaspes. Due to the mutiny of his homesick troops, he
        eventually turned back at the Beas River and later died in 323 BC in Babylon, the city of Mesopotamia that he
        had planned to establish as his empire's capital. Alexander's death left unexecuted an additional series of
        planned military and mercantile campaigns that would have begun with a Greek invasion of Arabia. In the years
        following his death, a series of civil wars broke out across the Macedonian Empire, eventually leading to its
        disintegration at the hands of the Diadochi.

        With his death marking the start of the Hellenistic period, Alexander's legacy includes the cultural diffusion
        and syncretism that his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism and Hellenistic Judaism. He founded more
        than twenty cities, with the most prominent being the city of Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of
        Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture led to the overwhelming dominance of Hellenistic
        civilization and influence as far east as the Indian subcontinent. The Hellenistic period developed through the
        Roman Empire into modern Western culture; the Greek language became the lingua franca of the region and was the
        predominant language of the Byzantine Empire until its collapse in the mid-15th century AD. <br>

        Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of Achilles, featuring prominently in the historical
        and mythical traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. His military achievements and unprecedented
        enduring successes in battle made him the measure against which many later military leaders would compare
        themselves,[f] and his tactics remain a significant subject of study in military academies worldwide.[7] Legends
        of Alexander's exploits coalesced into the third-century Alexander Romance which, in the premodern period, went
        through over one hundred recensions, translations, and derivations and was translated into almost every European
        vernacular and every language of the Islamic world.[8] After the Bible, it was the most popular form of European
        literature.[9]</p>

    <h2>Lineage and childhood</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Alexander III was born in Pella, the capital of the Kingdom of Macedon,[10] on the sixth day of the ancient Greek
        month of Hekatombaion, which probably corresponds to 20 July 356 BC (although the exact date is
        uncertain).[11][12] He was the son of the erstwhile king of Macedon, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias
        (daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of Epirus).[13][g] Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his
        principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander.[14]</p>
    <p>Several legends surround Alexander's birth and childhood.[15] According to the ancient Greek biographer Plutarch,
        on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip, Olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a
        thunderbolt that caused a flame to spread "far and wide" before dying away. Sometime after the wedding, Philip
        is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with a seal engraved with a lion's image.[16]
        Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations for these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage,
        indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was Zeus. Ancient commentators were divided
        about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming
        that she had told Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.[16]
ს
        On the day Alexander was born, Philip was preparing a siege on the city of Potidea on the peninsula of
        Chalcidice. That same day, Philip received news that his general Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian
        and Paeonian armies and that his horses had won at the Olympic Games. It was also said that on this day, the
        Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, burnt down. This led Hegesias of Magnesia
        to say that it had burnt down because Artemis was away, attending the birth of Alexander.[17] Such legends may
        have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly at his instigation, to show that he was superhuman and
        destined for greatness from conception.[15] <br>

        In his early years, Alexander was raised by a nurse, Lanike, sister of Alexander's future general Cleitus the
        Black. Later in his childhood, Alexander was tutored by the strict Leonidas, a relative of his mother, and by
        Lysimachus of Acarnania.[18] Alexander was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths, learning to read,
        play the lyre, ride, fight, and hunt.[19] When Alexander was ten years old, a trader from Thessaly brought
        Philip a horse, which he offered to sell for thirteen talents. The horse refused to be mounted, and Philip
        ordered it away. Alexander, however, detecting the horse's fear of its own shadow, asked to tame the horse,
        which he eventually managed.[15] Plutarch stated that Philip, overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition,
        kissed his son tearfully, declaring: "My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions. Macedon is
        too small for you", and bought the horse for him.[20] Alexander named it Bucephalas, meaning "ox-head".
        Bucephalas carried Alexander as far as India. When the animal died (because of old age, according to Plutarch,
        at age 30), Alexander named a city after him, Bucephala.[21]</p>
